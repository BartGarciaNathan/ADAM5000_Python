# ADAM5000_Python
Python implementation for readout of the Thermocouple module on the ADAM-5000 Module


For the moment this is a simple python implementation to connect and gather data from the Thermocouple I/O Module on the ADAM-5000. The data is stored in a file called data.csv.

Later on more functions might be added to for the Thermocouple I/O and for other modules.  Is you want to expand this project please do so, just send me and email or make a pull request.
